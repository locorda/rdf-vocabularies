## Overview

[🌐 **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_vocabularies/)

`locorda_rdf_terms_common` provides type-safe access to **core RDF vocabulary terms** as Dart constants for use with [`rdf_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/rdf_core). 

This package contains the **essential RDF vocabularies** (~5MB) that cover most semantic web applications without the large Schema.org vocabularies.

## 📦 Package Selection Guide

| Package | Download Size | Content | Best For |
|---------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **`locorda_rdf_terms_common`** (this package) | **~5MB** | Core RDF vocabularies | Most applications |
| **[`rdf_vocabularies`](https://pub.dev/packages/rdf_vocabularies)** | ~77MB | All vocabularies | Full compatibility |
| **[`locorda_rdf_terms_schema`](https://pub.dev/packages/locorda_rdf_terms_schema)** | ~35MB | Schema.org HTTPS | Schema.org apps |
| **[`locorda_rdf_terms_schema_http`](https://pub.dev/packages/locorda_rdf_terms_schema_http)** | ~36MB | Schema.org HTTP | Legacy compatibility |

The library is designed for both RDF newcomers and experts, offering structured ways to work with semantic data while maintaining compilation-time safety.

## Part of a whole family of projects

If you are looking for more rdf-related functionality, have a look at our companion projects:

* basic graph classes as well as turtle/jsonld/n-triple encoding and decoding: [rdf_core](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_core) 
* encode and decode rdf/xml format: [rdf_xml](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_xml) 
* generate your own easy-to-use constants for other vocabularies with a build_runner: [rdf_vocabulary_to_dart](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabulary_to_dart)
* map Dart Objects ↔️ RDF: [rdf_mapper](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_mapper)

## Package Characteristics

- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Nearly all content is composed of compile-time constants
- **Small Binary Size**: Minimal impact on your application's size
- **Type Safety**: Catch vocabulary usage errors at compile time
- **IDE Assistance**: Get autocompletion and documentation directly in your editor

## Features

- **Dual Interface**: Choose between class-specific access for beginners or full vocabulary access for experts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access terms from popular RDF vocabularies (Schema.org, FOAF, Dublin Core, etc.)
- **Rich Documentation**: Each term includes its original description from the vocabulary
- **Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with the `rdf_core` library

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the package to your project:

```sh
# Install core vocabularies package (~5MB)
dart pub add locorda_rdf_terms_common rdf_core
```

### Why Choose Core Package?

- **Smaller Download**: Only ~5MB vs ~77MB for the full meta-package
- **Essential Vocabularies**: Includes RDF, RDFS, OWL, FOAF, Dublin Core, SKOS, and more
- **Most Use Cases**: Covers the majority of semantic web applications
- **Add Schema.org Later**: Easily add Schema.org vocabularies if needed

## Usage

### For RDF Newcomers: Class-Specific Approach

If you're new to RDF, the class-specific approach guides you to use the correct properties for each type of resource:

```dart
import 'package:locorda_rdf_core/core.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_common/foaf.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_core/rdf.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_core/xsd.dart';

void main() {
  final personIri = IriTerm('http://example.org/person/jane_doe');
  
  // Create a graph using class-specific constants
  final graph = RdfGraph.fromTriples([
    // Use FoafPerson class for type-safe property access
    Triple(personIri, Rdf.type, FoafPerson.classIri),
    Triple(personIri, FoafPerson.name, LiteralTerm.string('Jane Doe')),
    Triple(personIri, FoafPerson.givenName, LiteralTerm.string('Jane')),
    Triple(personIri, FoafPerson.familyName, LiteralTerm.string('Doe')),
    Triple(personIri, FoafPerson.age, LiteralTerm.integer(42)),
    Triple(personIri, FoafPerson.mbox, IriTerm('mailto:jane.doe@example.com')),
  ]);
  
  print(RdfCore.withStandardCodecs().encode(graph));
```

**Benefits**: IDE autocompletion, compile-time validation, guided vocabulary discovery.

### For RDF Experts: Direct Vocabulary Approach

Use vocabulary classes directly for maximum flexibility:

```dart
import 'package:locorda_rdf_core/core.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_common/foaf.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_core/rdf.dart';
import 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_common/dc.dart';

void main() {
  final personIri = IriTerm('http://example.org/person/jane_doe');
  
  // Create a graph with direct vocabulary access
  final graph = RdfGraph.fromTriples([
    Triple(personIri, Rdf.type, Foaf.Person),
    Triple(personIri, Foaf.name, LiteralTerm.string('Jane Doe')),
    Triple(personIri, Foaf.age, LiteralTerm.integer(42)),
    Triple(personIri, Dc.creator, LiteralTerm.string('System')),
  ]);
  
  print(RdfCore.withStandardCodecs().encode(graph));
}
```

**Benefits**: Maximum flexibility, concise syntax, mix vocabularies freely.

## Core Vocabularies Included

This package includes the essential RDF vocabularies for most semantic web applications:

- **RDF**: Resource Description Framework base vocabulary
- **RDFS**: RDF Schema vocabulary  
- **OWL**: Web Ontology Language
- **FOAF**: Friend of a Friend vocabulary
- **DC/DCTerms**: Dublin Core vocabularies (metadata)
- **SKOS**: Simple Knowledge Organization System
- **VCard**: vCard ontology for contacts
- **XSD**: XML Schema Datatypes
- **ACL**: Web Access Control vocabulary
- **Contact**: Contact information vocabulary
- **EventOwl**: Event vocabulary
- **GEO**: Geospatial vocabulary
- **LDP**: Linked Data Platform vocabulary
- **Solid**: Solid platform vocabulary
- **VS**: Vocabulary Status ontology

## Adding Schema.org Support

If you need Schema.org vocabularies, add them separately:

```sh
# Modern Schema.org with HTTPS URIs (+35MB)
dart pub add locorda_rdf_terms_schema

# Legacy Schema.org with HTTP URIs (+36MB) 
dart pub add locorda_rdf_terms_schema_http
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Nearly all content consists of compile-time constants
- **Optimized Size**: Only ~5MB vs ~77MB for the full package
- **Type Safety**: Catch vocabulary usage errors at compile time
- **IDE Integration**: Get autocompletion and documentation directly in your editor

## Upgrading from Meta-Package

Easily switch from the full `rdf_vocabularies` package to optimize size:

```sh
# Remove the large meta-package
dart pub remove rdf_vocabularies

# Add the optimized core package
dart pub add locorda_rdf_terms_common

# Update imports from 'package:locorda_rdf_terms/' to 'package:locorda_rdf_terms_common/'
```

The API remains identical - only import paths change.
