  /// IRI for schema:StatisticalPopulation
  ///
  /// A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property {[populationType]} is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a {[StatisticalPopulation]} representing all {[Person]}s with a {[homeLocation]} of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate {[homeLocation]} and {[populationType]} properties to a {[StatisticalPopulation]} item that stands for that set of people.
  /// The properties {[numConstraints]} and {[constraintProperty]} are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
  /// population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a {[populationType]} of {[Event]} or {[NewsArticle]} could be used. See also {[Observation]}, where a {[populationType]} such as {[Person]} or {[Event]} can be indicated directly.

  ///

  /// IRI for schema:StatisticalVariable
  ///
  /// {[StatisticalVariable]} represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for {[StatisticalVariable]} is typically expressed using {[Observation]} with an explicit {[populationType]}, which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each {[StatisticalVariable]} is marked as a {[ConstraintNode]}, meaning that some properties (those listed using {[constraintProperty]}) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a {[StatisticalVariable]} Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is {[Person]}; the measuredProperty {[height]}; the {[statType]} {[median]}; the {[gender]} {[Female]}. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of {[StatisticalVariable]}s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The {[measurementMethod]}, {[unitCode]} and {[unitText]} properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).
