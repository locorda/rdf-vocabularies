In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, "You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500" would be:</p>

  /// "price": 10,

  /// "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"
  /// }
  /// <p>{[LoanOrCredit]}: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>
