/// FloorPlan class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some {[ApartmentComplex]} has an {[accommodationFloorPlan]} which is a {[FloorPlan]}.  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger {[ApartmentComplex]} or a single {[Apartment]}. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated using {[image]}.
