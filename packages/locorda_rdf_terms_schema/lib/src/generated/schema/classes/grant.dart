/// Grant class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of resources. Typically a {[funder]} sponsors some {[MonetaryAmount]} to an {[Organization]} or {[Person]},
/// sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived {[Project]}, resulting in one or more outputs, or {[fundedItem]}s. For financial sponsorship, indicate the {[funder]} of a {[MonetaryGrant]}. For non-financial support, indicate {[sponsor]} of {[Grant]}s of resources (e.g. office space).
///
/// Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective goals, often but not always organized as {[Project]}s. Long-lived projects are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common for a project to be associated with a single grant.
