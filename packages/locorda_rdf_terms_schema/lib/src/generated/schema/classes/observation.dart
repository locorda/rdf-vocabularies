/// Observation class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// Instances of the class {[Observation]} are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an {[Observation]} are {[observationAbout]}, {[measuredProperty]}, {[statType]}, {[value] and {[observationDate]}  and {[measuredProperty]}. Some but not all Observations represent a {[QuantitativeValue]}. Quantitative observations can be about a {[StatisticalVariable]}, which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time.
///
/// Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and {[value]} )
///
/// In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include {[measuredProperty]}, {[observationAbout]}, {[observationDate]}, {[value]}, {[unitCode]}, {[unitText]}, {[measurementMethod]}.
