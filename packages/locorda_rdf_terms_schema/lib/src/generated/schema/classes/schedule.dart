/// Schedule class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring {[Event]}. At a minimum a schedule will specify {[repeatFrequency]} which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
/// This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
/// have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
///
/// Inherits from:
/// - Intangible (https://schema.org/Intangible)
/// - Resource (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource)
/// - Thing (https://schema.org/Thing)
